# Python-Machine-Learning-Model

This is machine learning modeller to predict user credit score with 120ish features. 
Some models such as Logistic Regression and HistGradient Boosting, Random Forest (found NaN values on test dataset) are applied in order to comply with local regulator (not containing black box - regulatory explainable).
Not using joblib at the moment, so you can enjoy full syntax easily. Will add some credits in very near future.

# Happy Coding!
